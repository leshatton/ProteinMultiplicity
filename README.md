# ProteinMultiplicity

## Aug 2022

This is a complete reproducibility package for the Protein Multiplicity paper allowing all figures and statistical
analyses to be reproduced.  All necessary source code and scripts are included.

The overall methodology is described in:-

https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06897  "Full Computational Reproducibility in Biological Science:
Methods, Software and a Case Study in Protein Biology", Les Hatton and Greg Warr.

The 0- scripts are run first; then the 1-scripts, then the 2-scripts, the 3-scripts and finally the
4-script.  Onscreen instructions are embedded in each.
