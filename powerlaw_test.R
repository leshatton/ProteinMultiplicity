#	This package uses the methods of Clauset, Shalizi and Newman (2009)
#	to test whether we have a power-law with greater refinement.

#	Estimate the xmin and the exponent Î± of the power law, and assign them to the power law object

#	visual estimate.

#
#	KS statistic tells you how well power law distribution fits your data, but it 
#	doesn't tell you how likely your data is drawn from power law. So you also need a p value. 
#	This is how you do it:  (Note, no of sims = 1000 requires several hours).
